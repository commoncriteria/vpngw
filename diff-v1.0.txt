										      >	The scope of this Protection Profile Module
										      >	([PP-Module](#abbr_PP-Module)) is to describe the security functionality
										      >	of a virtual private network ([VPN](#abbr_VPN)) gateway in terms of
										      >	[\[CC\]](#bibCC) and to define functional and assurance requirements for
										      >	such products. This [PP-Module](#abbr_PP-Module) is intended for use
										      >	with the following Base-PPs:
										      >
										      >	-   collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices, Version 2.2E
										      >	    (NDcPP or CPP\_ND\_V2.2E)
										      >
										      >	This [Base-PP](#abbr_Base-PP) is valid because a [VPN](#abbr_VPN)
										      >	gateway is a device at the edge of a private network that terminates an
										      >	IPsec tunnel, which provides device authentication, confidentiality, and
										      >	integrity of information traversing a public or untrusted network. This
										      >	is functionality that typically will be implemented by a network device.
										      >
										      >	A Target of Evaluation ([TOE](#abbr_TOE)) that conforms to a
										      >	[PP-Configuration](#abbr_PP-Configuration) containing this
										      >	[PP-Module](#abbr_PP-Module) may be a 'Distributed [TOE](#abbr_TOE)' as
										      >	defined in the NDcPP; however, the [VPN](#abbr_VPN) gateway
										      >	functionality described in this [PP-Module](#abbr_PP-Module) should be
										      >	in a single [TOE](#abbr_TOE) component. This
										      >	[PP-Module](#abbr_PP-Module) does not prohibit the [TOE](#abbr_TOE) from
										      >	implementing other security functionality in a distributed manner. For
										      >	example, a [TOE](#abbr_TOE) may have a centralized device that performs
										      >	[VPN](#abbr_VPN) gateway and other security functionality (such as
										      >	intrusion prevention) with a number of distributed nodes that help in
										      >	the enforcement of the secondary functionality.
