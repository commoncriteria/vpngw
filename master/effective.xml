    <sec:Overview>
      The scope of this Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) is to describe the security functionality of a virtual private network (VPN)
      gateway in terms of  <xref g="CC"/> and to define functional and assurance requirements for such
      products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:

      <h:ul>
        <h:li>collaborative Protection Profile for Network Devices, Version 3.0E (NDcPP or CPP_ND_V3.0E)</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      <h:p>
      This Base-PP is valid because a VPN gateway is a device at the edge of a private network that terminates
      an IPsec tunnel, which provides device authentication, confidentiality, and integrity of information
      traversing a public or untrusted network. This is functionality that typically will be implemented by a
      network device.
      </h:p><h:p>
      A Target of Evaluation (TOE) that conforms to a PP-Configuration containing this PP-Module may be a ‘Distributed TOE’ as
      defined in the NDcPP; however, the VPN gateway functionality described in this PP-Module should be in
      a single TOE component. This PP-Module does not prohibit the TOE from implementing other security
      functionality in a distributed manner. For example, a TOE may have a centralized device that performs
      VPN gateway and other security functionality (such as intrusion prevention) with a number of distributed
      nodes that help in the enforcement of the secondary functionality.

    <!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation -->
    <sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
      <h:p>
      This PP-Module specifically addresses network gateway devices that terminate IPsec VPN tunnels. A
      compliant VPN gateway is a device composed of hardware and software that is connected to two or more
      distinct networks and has an infrastructure role in the overall enterprise network. In particular, a VPN
      gateway establishes a secure tunnel that provides an authenticated and encrypted path to one or more other sites
      and thereby decreases the risk of exposure of information transiting an untrusted network.
      </h:p><h:p>
      The baseline requirements of this PP-Module are those determined necessary for a multi-site VPN
      gateway device. A compliant TOE may also contain the ability to act as a headend for remote clients.
      Because this capability is optional, the remote client-based requirements have been included in
      Appendix A.
      </h:p>
      
      <!-- 1.3.1 TOE Boundary -->
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
        The physical boundary for a TOE that conforms to this PP-Module is a hardware appliance that also
        provides generalized network device functionality, such as auditing, identification and authentication, and cryptographic services for
        network communications. The TOE’s logical boundary includes all functionality required by the claimed
        Base-PP as well as the VPN functionality and related capabilities that are defined in this PP-Module. Any
        functionality that is provided by the network device that is not relevant to the security requirements
        defined by this PP-Module or the Base-PP is considered to be outside the scope of the TOE.

    <!-- 1.4 Use Cases -->
    <sec:Use_Cases>
      This PP-Module defines two potential use cases for the VPN gateway TOE, defined below. The first use
      case will always be applicable for a TOE that conforms to this PP-Module. The second use case defines an
      optional deployment for the TOE that accompanies the first use case.

          <description>
            The VPN gateway is part of the functionality that is provided by a general network device appliance, such

            functionality.

  <!-- Security Problem Description -->
  <sec:Security_Problem_Definition>
    The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address,
assumptions about its operational environment (OE), and any organizational security policies that the TOE is
expected to enforce.<h:br/>
    
    <!-- Note: Module 1.1 mapped threats to objectives (objective is primary key of the table) whereas the more typical format is to map it the other way around. Mappings here have been updated to reflect this.
    As a side effect of this, there is no way the current schema can capture what was done for 1.1 where a TOE objective further mitigates a threat that exists only in the Base-PP, specifically:
    - O.FAIL_SECURE, previously mapped only to Base-PP T.SECURITY_FUNCTIONALITY_FAILURE, now unmapped which will fail ACE_OBJ
    - O.TOE_ADMINISTRATION, previously mapped only to Base-PP T.UNAUTHORIZED_ADMINISTRATOR_ACCESS, now unmapped which will fail ACE_OBJ
    - O.SYSTEM_MONITORING, previously mapped to T.NETWORK_MISUSE from the Module and T.UNDETECTED_ACTIVITY from the Base-PP - this not a Part 3 failure on its own since it's still mapped, but additional context from the old Module is lost
    when doing it this way
    How should these be handled?

        <threat name="T.NETWORK_ACCESS">
          <description> 
            Devices located outside the protected network may seek to exercise services located on the protected
            network that are intended to only be accessed from inside the protected network or only accessed by
            entities using an authenticated path into the protected network. Devices located outside the
            protected network may, likewise, offer services that are inappropriate for access from within the
            protected network.
            <h:br/>
            From an ingress perspective, VPN gateways can be configured so that only those network servers
            intended for external consumption by entities operating on a trusted network (e.g., machines
            operating on a network where the peer VPN gateways are supporting the connection) are accessible
            and only via the intended ports. This serves to mitigate the potential for network entities outside a
            protected network to access network servers or services intended only for consumption or access
            inside a protected network.
            <h:br/>
            From an egress perspective, VPN gateways can be configured so that only specific external services
            (e.g., based on destination port) can be accessed from within a protected network, or moreover are
            accessed via an encrypted channel. For example, access to external mail services can be blocked to
            enforce corporate policies against accessing uncontrolled email servers, or, that access to the mail
            server must be done over an encrypted link.

        <threat name="T.NETWORK_DISCLOSURE">
          <description>
            Devices on a protected network may be exposed to threats presented by devices located outside the
            protected network, which may attempt to conduct unauthorized activities. If known malicious
            external devices are able to communicate with devices on the protected network, or if devices on the
            protected network can establish communications with those external devices (e.g., as a result of a
            phishing episode or by inadvertent responses to email messages), then those internal devices may be
            susceptible to the unauthorized disclosure of information.
            <h:br/>
            From an infiltration perspective, VPN gateways serve not only to limit access to only specific
            destination network addresses and ports within a protected network, but whether network traffic will
            be encrypted or transmitted in plaintext. With these limits, general network port scanning can be
            prevented from reaching protected networks or machines, and access to information on a protected
            network can be limited to that obtainable from specifically configured ports on identified network
            nodes (e.g., web pages from a designated corporate web server). Additionally, access can be limited
            to only specific source addresses and ports so that specific networks or network nodes can be blocked
            from accessing a protected network thereby further limiting the potential disclosure of information.
            <h:br/>
            From an exfiltration perspective, VPN gateways serve to limit how network nodes operating on a
            protected network can connect to and communicate with other networks limiting how and where
            they can disseminate information. Specific external networks can be blocked altogether or egress
            could be limited to specific addresses or ports. Alternately, egress options available to network
            nodes on a protected network can be carefully managed in order to, for example, ensure that

            Devices located outside the protected network, while permitted to access particular public services
            offered inside the protected network, may attempt to conduct inappropriate activities while
            communicating with those allowed public services. Certain services offered from within a protected
            network may also represent a risk when accessed from outside the protected network.
            <h:br/>
            From an ingress perspective, it is generally assumed that entities operating on external networks are
            not bound by the use policies for a given protected network. Nonetheless, VPN gateways can log
            policy violations that might indicate violation of publicized usage statements for publicly available
            services.
            <h:br/>
            From an egress perspective, VPN gateways can be configured to help enforce and monitor protected
            network use policies. As explained in the other threats, a VPN gateway can serve to limit dissemination
            of data, access to external servers, and even disruption of services – all of these could be related to
            the use policies of a protected network and as such are subject in some regards to enforcement.
            Additionally, VPN gateways can be configured to log network usages that cross between protected
            and external networks and as a result can serve to identify potential usage policy violations.

    The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) included in this section are derived from Part 2 of the
    Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 5, with
    additional extended functional components.<h:br/>
    The CC defines operations on Security Functional Requirements: assignments, selections, assignments
    within selections and refinements. This document uses the following font conventions to identify the
    operations defined by the CC:<h:br/>
    <h:ul>
      <h:li>Assignments are indicated with <h:i>italicized</h:i> text.</h:li>
      <h:li>Refinements made by the PP-Module author are indicated with <h:b>bold text</h:b> for added or substituted
        text and <h:s>strikethrough</h:s> text for removed text. Refinements are only applied to significant technical
        changes to existing SFRs; minor presentation changes with no technical impact (such as British vs
        American spelling differences) are not marked as refinements. Refinements are also indicated when
        an operation is added or substituted for an existing operation (e.g., the PP-Module completes an
        assignment in such a way that it introduces a selection into the assignment).<h:br/>
        Note that for SFRs that are defined either in CC Part 2 or in this PP-Module’s Extended Components
        Definition, the refinement operation is used to indicate deviations from the defined component. For
        Base-PP SFRs that are modified by this PP-Module, the refinement operation is used to indicate
        deviations from the Base-PP’s definition of the SFR (i.e., if the Base-PP refined an SFR and that
        change is not affected by this PP-Module, it is not shown here as a refinement).</h:li>
      <h:li>Selections are indicated with <h:i>italicized</h:i> text.</h:li>
      <h:li>Iteration is indicated by appending the SFR name with a slash and unique identifier suggesting the
        purpose of the iteration, e.g., ‘/VPN’ for an SFR relating to VPN gateway functionality.</h:li>
      <h:li>Extended SFRs are identified by having a label “EXT” after the SFR name.</h:li>
    </h:ul>
    Note that selections and assignments to be completed by the ST author are preceded with “selection:”
    and “assignment:”. If text is italicized and does not include either of these, it means that the selection or
    assignment has already been completed in this PP-Module and the ST author must use the text as
    written.

                Since certificates are required for authentication, IKEv1 does not support PSKs, as 
                PSK-based authentication and certificate-based authentication are mutually exclusive in IKEv1.

                    At least one public-key-based Peer Authentication method is required in order to

                    the ST author to reflect what is implemented. The ST author also ensures that
                    appropriate FCS requirements reflecting the algorithms used (and key
                    generation capabilities, if provided) are listed to support those methods. Note
                    that the TSS will elaborate on the way in which these algorithms are to be used.
                    <h:br/><h:br/>
                    If “IKEv1” is selected, “no other method” must be chosen in the third selection.

                    If a selection with “EAP-TLS” or “EAP-TTLS” is chosen, the selection-based requirement FCS_EAP_EXT.1 must be claimed. 
                    When an EAP method is used, verification occurs via an external authentication server. 
                    Though EAP-TTLS involves PSKs, FIA_PSK_EXT.1 is not claimed because PSK requirements for EAP-TTLS are addressed instead via 
                    the Authentication Server PP. EAP-based authentication is not supported for IKEv1.

                    If “pre-shared keys that conform to RFC 8784” is chosen, the selection-based requirement FIA_PSK_EXT.1 must be claimed. 
                    Since certificates are required for authentication, IKEv1 does not support PSKs, as 
                    PSK-based authentication and certificate-based authentication are mutually exclusive in IKEv1. 
                    Note that IKEv1 will be removed in a future version of this document.

              <h:p><h:b>FPT_TUD_EXT.1.3</h:b>: The text of the requirement is replaced with:</h:p>
              <h:p>The TSF shall provide means to authenticate firmware/software updates to the
                TOE using a <h:b>digital signature mechanism and </h:b>[<h:b>selection:</h:b> <h:i>X.509 certificate, no other mechanisms</h:i>]
                prior to installing those updates.</h:p>
              <h:p><h:b>Application Note: </h:b>
                The NDcPP provides an option for how firmware/software updates can be verified
                but this PP-Module requires the digital signature method to be selected at
                minimum. Note that all other options specified in the NDcPP for this component
                are permitted so it is possible for the TSF to use code signing certificates to
                validate updates, in which case FPT_TUD_EXT.2 from the Base-PP is also included
                in the ST.
                <h:br/>
                If X.509 certificates are used to verify the integrity of an update, the certificates
                must conform to FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev. Therefore, certificates that do not (or only
                partially) conform to FIA_X509_EXT.1/REV are not allowed as a means to
                authenticate firmware/software updates.
                <h:br/>
                NDcPP states the ST author may use X.509 certificates that do not meet
                FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev. This applies to trust anchors as they can be encoded as
                certificates. Even when they are encoded as certificates, the trust anchor must be
                protected by another mechanism that ensures its integrity and binds it to the
                'code-signing' context. Trust anchors do not need to be validated according to
                FIA_X509_EXT.1, even if they are encoded as certificates; instead they need to be
                validated as trust anchors. FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev does not require revocation
                checking of certificates designated as trust store elements. The integrity of trust
                store elements depends on administrative controls for loading and managing
                trust stores and functional integrity checks that are described in other SFRs.
                <h:br/>
                So, if the certificate used to verify the update is a trust store element (self-signed
                and specifically trusted for verifying updates, with the integrity of this special
                purpose certificate protected by administrative controls and TOE integrity
                protections), then revocation checking is not required.
                <h:br/>
                However, if the certificate is issued by a trusted root CA, or by a certificate
                authority which chains to a trusted root CA, then revocation checking is required
                for all elements of the certificate chain except the trusted root CA, and the TOE
                must be able to obtain fresh revocation information from an external source.

        ACE_ECD requirements. Specifically, the following text in Module v1.1 is needed for Class FPF to precede the sub-header for FPF_RUL_EXT because CC Part 2 does not define Class FPF.
        Alternatively, we could just change it to an existing class (e.g., FDP_RUL_EXT.1 since packet filtering isn't fundamentally all that different from FDP_IFC/IFF behavior). -->
        <!-- 
        Class FPF: Packet Filtering
This class contains families that describe packet filtering behavior. Packet filtering refers to the notion that
network traffic that is transmitted “through” the TOE (i.e., the source and destination of the traffic is not
the TOE but the TOE is on the routing path between these two entities) can be treated differently by the
TSF based on attributes associated with the traffic. As this class is defined solely to contain an extended
component defined for this PP-Module, it only has one family, FPF_RUL_EXT.

              This element identifies the protocols and references the protocol definitions that
              serve to define to what extent the network traffic can be interpreted by the TOE
              when importing (receiving network traffic or ingress) and exporting (sending–or
              forming to be sent–network traffic or egress).
              <h:br/>
              While the protocol formatting specified in the RFCs is still used, many RFCs define
              behaviors which are no longer considered safe to follow. For example, RFC 792
              defined the “Redirect” Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) type, which is not considered safe to honor when it
              might come from an adversary; the “source quench” message, which is insecure
              because its source cannot be validated.

              It also identifies the various attributes that are applicable when constructing rules
              to be enforced by this requirement – the applicable interface is a property of the
              TOE and the rest of the identified attributes are defined in the associated RFCs.
              Note that the Protocol is the IPv4 field (in IPv6 this field is called the “next header”)
              that identifies the applicable protocol, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc. Also,
              ‘Interface’ identified above is the external port where the applicable network
              traffic was received or alternately will be sent.

              This element identifies where rules can be assigned. Specifically, a conforming TOE
              must be able to assign filtering rules specific to each of its available and
              identifiable distinct network interfaces that handle layer 3 and 4 network traffic.
              Identifiable means the interface is unique and identifiable within the TOE, and
              does not necessarily require the interface to be visible from the network
              perspective (e.g., does not need to have an IP address assigned to it). A distinct
              network interface is one or more physical connections that share a common
              logical path into the TOE. For example, the TOE might have a small form-factor
              pluggable (SFP) port supporting SFP modules that expose a number of physical
              network ports, but since a common driver is used for all external ports they can
              be treated as a single distinct network interface.

              Note that there could be a separate ruleset for each interface or alternately a

                    ensure that the first rule is enforced in both cases by generating applicable packets and using packet
                    capture and logs for confirmation.</test>

                    test both orders to ensure that the first is enforced regardless of the specificity of the rule.

                  <test>The evaluator shall compose a pre-shared key of at least 64 characters that contains a combination of the allowed characters in accordance with the FIA_PSK_EXT.3.2 and verify that a successful protocol negotiation can be performed with the key. </test>

The minimum test should be successful, and the invalid lengths must be rejected by the TOE. </test>
                  <test>[conditional]: If the TOE initiates connections, initiate and establish a remote connection, disconnect from the connection, verify that the PSK is required when initiating the connection a second time.</test>
                  <test>[conditional]: If the TOE supports a password meter, the evaluator shall enter a password and verify the password checker responds per the description in the TSS.</test>

	    This section contains requirements that may be optionally selected by the ST author for a “headend” VPN
	    gateway device. The requirements in the main body of this PP-Module are those determined necessary
	    for a multi-site VPN gateway appliance. Another application of a VPN appliance is in an architecture that
	    is intended to serve mobile users, by providing a secure means in which a remote client may access a
	    trusted network. These devices provide the capability to manage remote VPN clients (e.g., assigning IP
	    addresses, managing client sessions) that are not necessarily found in VPN gateways that are limited to
	    providing a secure communication path between trusted networks. Rather than mandate that all VPN
	    gateways provide this mobility aspect, the requirements below are specified as an option. What this
	    means is that multi-site VPN gateways do not have to provide these capabilities, but those devices wishing
	    to serve the mobility community should implement the optional requirements from this Appendix in
	    addition to all mandatory and selection-based requirements that apply to them.
